3. Player 1 starts by clicking on an empty cell on the grid to place their symbol (X).
4. Player 2 then takes their turn by clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol (O).
5. Players continue taking turns until one of the following conditions is met:
   - A player gets three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal, resulting in a win.
